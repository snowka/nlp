# This provides the most basic elements of a program using spaCY.
# Information from https://realpython.com/natural-language-processing-spacy-python/
# Before this, you must import spaCY with "pip install spacy" and
# download the models and date for the English language with
# python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

# Using these examples from Real Python
# Variable names ending with the suffix _text are Unicode string objects.
# Variable name ending with the suffix _doc are spaCyâ€™s language model objects.

import spacy
nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')
about_text = ('Gus Proto is a Python developer currently'
              ' working for a London-based Fintech'

              ' Natural Language Processing.')
about_doc = nlp(about_text)
sentences = list(about_doc.sents)

# This part of the script iterates through the about_doc variable
# and tokenizes the text
# the output lists each token and its starting index
for token in about_doc:
    print (token, token.idx)
